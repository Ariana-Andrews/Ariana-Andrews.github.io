      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        For my coding career to support my personal hobbies and interests, both
        financially and to supplement my creative skills. Career pathway wise, I
        am staying open to ideas and continuing to learn what options are/ could
        become available to me if I wish to work towards them.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to develop a fundamental understanding of how to set up a
        website, front and backend. The ability to set one up that acts as an
        online store would be a bonus. Human Skills wise, I would like to build
        a better tool kit for conflict resolution in the workplace.

      <h3>What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>
        I am aware of when I have resistance to certain tasks or learning
        objectives. This allows me to stop and reflect on what exactly is
        causing the resistance, and try to find ways to overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I push through difficult tasks or learning objectives, even if it takes
        a long time, to fully understand things that confuse me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m getting better at knowing when I’m becoming too frustrated and need
        to step away to ground myself and be in a better mindspace to problem
        solve effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m constantly improving my understanding of how I learn and which
        techniques keep me focused for longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being kind to myself and knowing when to take breaks and when to push
        on.

      <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
      <p>
        I struggle to comprehend/ absorb certain types of learning content, i.e
        written content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also struggle with written assignments, and probably take twice as
        long as the average person to complete simple tasks… like this one…
      </p>
      <p>
        I can struggle with discipline. Keeping a strict learning schedule is
        very difficult and currently I find setting time goals, and tracking how
        much time I actually study for, is better than saying I have to study
        from x-y. However, this might not always work for some situations/ work
        loads. I also struggle to switch tasks, especially if I am very
        interested or locked into the task that I am currently doing. I do
        prioritize studying and work, however I find that the lack of structure,
        although it keeps me in a calmer state (which I find better for
        absorbing information) does mean that I eat into my personal time. It’s
        a trade off that I am still working through.
