      <h2> Sprint Five </h2>
      <h3>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once
        you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am still unsure as to what I want to do after Dev Academy. At the end of the day I would like to get a job as
        a junior developer. However, some thoughts I have been having revolve around working for projects that improve
        health systems in New Zealand or creating website apps/plug-ins that make it easier for small businesses to
        succeed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout
        Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you
        during Bootcamp?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I really struggled to work out how to solve Javascript challenges when I didn’t understand what they were
        asking me to do. Breaking down the tasks into pseudo code was also very difficult for me, which is a bit
        frustrating since I think it would help me problem solve more effectively.
        A strength of mine is being able to analyse weak points in my learning. Being able to step away from the
        learning material to focus on areas that are leading to confusion and frustration has helped me stay grounded
        and not feel as overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in
        this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in
        front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I think my biggest challenge will be keeping a healthy study/work/life balance. When I was stressed during the
        foundations, I struggled to keep a structured learning plan. My study time wasn’t as effective and I stopped
        doing other hobbies like drawing or playing video games with friends. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your
        strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I would like to get better at reflecting, especially reflecting on how I approached technical challenges. I
        would also like to get better at team work skills, and working with others to create healthy/ productive work
        environments.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations,
        but it is helpful to voice these expectations.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Having the tutors available to do one-on-ones when stuck on challenges has been very helpful and I expect to be
        able to reach out to them and plan sessions when needed. I expect feedback to make sure I am meeting learning
        objectives to the standard required to pass the course.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
        Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an
        explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators
        and industry/community representatives.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I will create study plans bi-weekly based on the content material. I will reach out to tutors and book sessions
        when I am stuck on a task. I will do everything in my power to be available for group project sessions when we
        have arranged a specific time to meet up

      <h2>Sprint Two</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        For my coding career to support my personal hobbies and interests, both
        financially and to supplement my creative skills. Career pathway wise, I
        am staying open to ideas and continuing to learn what options are/ could
        become available to me if I wish to work towards them.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to develop a fundamental understanding of how to set up a
        website, front and backend. The ability to set one up that acts as an
        online store would be a bonus. Human Skills wise, I would like to build
        a better tool kit for conflict resolution in the workplace.
      </p>

      <h3>What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am an extremely fast visual learner (videos, images, live
          demonstrations).
        </li>
        <li>
          I am aware of when I have resistance to certain tasks or learning
          objectives. This allows me to stop and reflect on what exactly is
          causing the resistance, and try to find ways to overcome it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I push through difficult tasks or learning objectives, even if it
          takes a long time, to fully understand things that confuse me.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m getting better at knowing when I’m becoming too frustrated and
          need to step away to ground myself and be in a better mindspace to
          problem solve effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m constantly improving my understanding of how I learn and which
          techniques keep me focused for longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am getting better at being kind to myself and knowing when to take
          breaks and when to push on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span> </span>
      <h4>Weaknesses</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>I second guess myself a lot.</li>
        <li>
          I can find it hard to express myself/ articulate my thoughts in a
          written context.
        </li>
        <li>I am much slower at learning new skills from written content.</li>
        <li>
          I can find it difficult to know which task is more important to
          prioritize.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Regularly review my workload and monitor my progression through the
          learning objectives. Use Toggle to make sure I am keeping within the
          timebox expectations. Make notes on which subjects are taking me
          longer and allocate extra time to come back and review the material
          later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set clear goals/ and break up learning objectives into mini due dates
          when working with other learners on projects. Set catch ups before the
          mini due dates to make sure the team is keeping up with the work load/
          able to communicate if they need help or extra time before the project
          is due.
        </li>
        <li>
          When working together in a discord call, I will make sure that I can
          hear everyone clearly and have other members repeat themselves if two
          or more people talk at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turning off notifications/ distractions when working with other
          students to respect their time and energy as they work with me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take time to listen and review everyone's suggestions when working
          together as a team. Ask further questions about the suggestions to
          deepen my understanding of their perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will reach out to a study coach when I feel like I am falling behind
          to help re-structure my study schedule and try different study tools.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am committed to following the ‘Asking for Help’ guide from Sprint 1. I
        will do my best to explain what I am trying to do, describe what I think
        the issue is and what I have already tried. Adding my code to relevant
        questions so that other students and facilitators can clearly see where
        I may be going wrong.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I expect regular, clear feedback.</li>
        <li>To help build good team
          morale, especially when we are working on group projects.</li>

      </ul>

      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have 5-6hr shifts Saturday and Sunday, and wish to pencil out
        Thursdays as a day off to spend time with loved ones and reset for the
        week.
