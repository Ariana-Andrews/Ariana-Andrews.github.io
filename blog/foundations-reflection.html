      <h3> 
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
      I learnt that my habits around problem solving need refining. That I can maintain learning during moderate amounts of
      stress, but that once I am past a thresh-hold I lose the ability to absorb new information, even when I practice
      self-care. I am also uncomfortable with sharing my thoughts openly on the internet, especially around somewhat personal
      reflections.
      </p>
      <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
      Values, empathy and self-awareness dictate how you navigate learning and programming. Values impact what you focus on
      and prioritise. Empathy and self-awareness impact how you manage yourself, how well you can push yourself or give
      yourself space when it is needed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am surprised at how often I reflected on the learning in real life scenarios. I didn’t expect to be noting when I saw
        certain behavior patterns from those around me and how those thoughts impacted their engagement in the situation. It has
        made me reconsider how to express myself to others and how I should navigate work relationships.
      </p>
      <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
      The hardest part for me was finding a way to express myself to a fairly unknown audience. Sharing my thoughts online
      feels uncomfortable. I rarely post on facebook, or other social media, so it’s been something that I have had to adjust
      to.
      </p>
      <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web
      development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
      To help develop programmers who are able to problem-solve, work well with others and manage themselves in the work
      environment.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>I don’t think it’s a waste of time. Being able to think introspectively and have more control over the way we react to
      our environment can positively impact both our personal lives and our progression through the work force. I also think
      the content was presented in such a way that students can dive as deep as they want/feel they have the time for.</p>
