      <p>
        One evening I decided to call the police on my neighbors because they
        were fighting. I felt very uncomfortable and it took a while for me to
        think about it before I acted because I knew it’d be obvious that the
        call came from our house. The fight started off with aggressive yelling,
        but it wasn’t until I heard punches that I decided I was morally obliged
        to do something to break up the conflict. I considered going over myself
        to try and meditate, but it was clear to me that they were drunk and I
        had to consider my own safety. I also wasn’t sure if I had enough
        conflict resolutions skills myself to actually make a positive impact on
        the situation. Part of me felt uncertain about stepping into someone
        else's business, even if it was a fairly intense confrontation to me, I
        didn’t know them very well. The final straw was when I realised I could
        hear the home owners child crying out, asking them to stop. In terms of
        values, I’d say that my compassion and drive to help protect the child
        from violence overpowered my fear of being confronted by the homeowner.
        I am unsure if I made the best decision, or whether I should have tried
        talking to my neighbor first. Maybe it would have been kinder to him if
        I had come out asking if he needed help, and called the police if things
        had started to escalate from there.

        My parents shaped my compassion, kindness and desire to help others as
        well as my strong work ethic and tenacious tendencies. Whilst my
        partner's family increased my appreciation for family connection and
        work/life balance. My experience interacting with an online community of
        like-minded individuals has also deepened my appreciation for community
        and has pushed me to strengthen these connections both online and
        in-person. Growing up in Malaysia and traveling to nearby countries,
        after moving from a small NZ town, definitely opened my eyes to a wider
        world. It expanded my ideas of what was possible, formulated an
        understanding that humans have the potential to achieve so much more,
        and most importantly , exposed me to an even wider range of cultures,
        celebrations and communities. Without those experiences, I don’t think I
        would be the person I am today. I think I would have had a narrower
        outlook on life.

        I’m consistent, persistent, and I don't like giving up. This will help
        me push through challenging learning modules and keep trying when things
        are tough. Even though I think I struggle with absorbing information
        sometimes, I think I have a strong tool kit to help me break things
        down, stay motivated and keep myself balanced as I study.

        other strategies you would try now and why.

      <p>
        After a lot of thought on this question, I’ve realised that a lot of the
        tensions over certain events that have arisen in my places of work have
        never really been addressed. At most I would communicate my need, for
        example, needing backup behind the bar sooner, and the manager would
        either implement it or not. If they didn’t I would adjust my mentality
        towards the situation and just do the best that I could with the
        resources at my disposal. Overall, this question has made me realise
        that I don’t have specific strategies for solving ‘tension’ when
        collaborating with someone and this is something I am looking to
        improve.
