      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, acknowledge and
        control one's emotions. It is also the ability to consciously
        recognise/understand and influence the emotion of others around you.
        Goleman's five-part model depicts five constituents of EQ:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-awareness</li>
        <li>Self-regulation</li>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Social Skills</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How is EQ different from IQ?</h3>
      <h4>EQ</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Has five domains, as mentioned above.</li>
        <li>Understanding, noticing and regulating emotions</li>
        <li>
          Influenced by social and environmental factors, can be trained and
          developed over time
        </li>
        <li>Important for general well-being</li>
        <li>
          Can improve workplace productivity by creating constructive
          relationships and better group outcomes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>EQ</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Linear thinking, like logical reasoning, math/ language comprehension
          skills, spatial thinking, cognitive function and memory
        </li>
        <li>
          Considered to be something you are born with/ genetics and isnâ€™t as
          easy to develop
        </li>
        <li>
          elps to maintain focus, have more accuracy, respect/ reach deadlines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the foundation for a healthy work/ life
        environment. Having higher EQ allows you to manage your emotions and
        make thoughtful decisions, rather than reactive decisions. This can
        increase your productivity during individual tasks and group projects.
