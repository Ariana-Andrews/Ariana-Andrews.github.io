        <h3>Disucss a time that you were blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
        <ul id="ps-ul-style">
          <li>What was the problem?</li>
          <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
          <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
          <li>What did you learn?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have been blocked on every kata problem, okay, I got the first one…
          I tried using a variety of problem solving techniques, from googling,
          console.logging and reading error messages, to asking friends and
          tutors for help. Unfortunately my lack of comprehension is really
          getting in the way of my learning, and I’m just doing my best to clear
          my head and keep trying again and every day.
        </p>
        <h3>Discuss a time that you elegantly sovled a problem</h3>
        <p>This did not happen. Maybe next time!</p>
        <h3>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes:
        </h3>
        <h4>Pseudocode: 4/10</h4>
        <p>
          I understand why pseudocode would be a great tool for breaking down
          big steps/ projects. However, I really struggled to use it because I
          couldn’t understand what the task(s) was asking me to do. My friend
          has suggested that I should go back through old challenges and write
          pseudocode for things I have already completed. I think this could
          really help get better at using it as a tool.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying something: 10/10</h4>
        <p>
          I did a lot of this! I began to record every attempt that I made. This
          helped me keep track of what I had tried, to prevent myself from going
          around in circles. I also reached out to friends and they would
          explain what my attempt was doing. Sometimes this helped me understand
          what I needed to change to get the desired outcome.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber ducky method 4/10</h4>
        <p>
          I’m not sure if the rubber ducky method really helped me during this
          sprint, however, as a visual person, I tried drawing what I thought
          the code might look like and found it easier to visualize what the
          code needed to do.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages: 5/10</h4>
        <p>
          I find the small error symbols from visual studio to be helpful to a
          degree, however the test error messages went right over my head half
          the time. I think developing my fundamental understanding of
          javascript will improve this over time.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging: 5/10</h4>
        <p>
          I like console logging, and I think I will get better at using this
          tool as I use it more often. I do find it difficult to use it as a
          problem solving tool, as my knowledge is too limited to do much with
          the information that I get out of it.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling: 7/10</h4>
        <p>
          Googling was hit and miss for me this sprint. I find it very useful
          for basic foundational knowledge, but when it comes to combining
          multiple elements, I couldn’t find the information I was after. At
          least I was able to find good content to go over some foundations
          again.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers for help: 9/10</h4>
        <p>
          I have a really strong group of friends who are always down to help
          and I feel safe asking them for assistance. I am extremely grateful
          for their time, and how they break down problems into bite sized
          pieces, without directly giving me the answer.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking coaches for help 6/10.</h4>
        <p>
          I found that I needed to step out of my comfort zone to ask for help
          from a coach, especially since I am more comfortable feeling
          vulnerable around my friends. However I also believe that not reaching
          out to my tutor was wasting a valuable resource.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving your process with reflection: 5/10</h4>
        <p>
          I find it hard to reflect when I haven’t achieved the outcome I am
          looking for. It’s easier when I can walk back through my steps and
          think about streamlining processes, rather than reflecting when I’m
          lost and don’t know what the next step should be. Hopefully I will
          find some good prompts that help me when I am lost.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I was originally reluctant to ask for help from a coach/tutor because
          I felt like I didn’t have a specific issue to ask about. I couldn't
          articulate how lost I felt with <i>all</i> of the tech content and I
          didn't want to waste my tutors time. Next time I may try to focus on
          <i>one</i> goal to achieve with help from my tutor.
