        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h3>
        <p>
          When people understand the principles of neuroplasticity, it helps
          them understand that intelligence can be developed. It can also help
          them create better learning environments. The task at hand should have
          learning material that is targeted, significant to the objective,
          relevant and ideally individualized. The material should be repeated
          in different ways to strengthen the brain's connections and memory.
          The material should be engaging, which is important for
          neuroplasticity. Improving material to help learn may look like
          creating multisensory tasks, learning through play, and storytelling
          to help deepen the students' connection to the material.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will focus on one learning objective at a time and reduce other
          distractions whilst learning a new skill. I will also try to come back
          to old learning material and practice it regularly.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          The following activities should be done regularly to increase your
          brain's neuroplasticity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn new skills</li>
          <li>Exercise/ do physical activity</li>
          <li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet</li>
          <li>Get good rest and sleep</li>
          <li>Manage your stress levels and decrease cortisol</li>
          <li>Engage in social activities</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Discuss what it is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          It is a mindset that helps enable people to push through hard learning
          or challenging times. It is a perspective that often correlates to not
          being afraid of failure or asking for help. In relation to learning
          how to code, this mindset may help students to push through difficult
          coding challenges, whether it’s asking for help, or giving it a try
          even if they don’t understand how to solve the problem right away.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it hard to understand growth mindset, but after reading 'What
          Can Be Learned From Growth Mindset Controversies?' I was able to see
          how it connected to learning environments and general life.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will try to seek feedback, use positive language, be curious and
          practice listening. I also found an article (linked below) that merges
          growth mindset with mindfulness which I found constructive.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The only way forward is through the emotions or problems and by
          following these steps we can start to tame and harness these tricky
          emotions: Name the feeling. Acknowledge it – sit with it – notice it
          with compassion and curiosity. Put it in perspective. Make a plan that
          links with your values and combines the ingredients of both grit and
          grace. “
