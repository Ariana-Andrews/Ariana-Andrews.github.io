        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h3>
        <p>
          When people understand the principles of neuroplasticity, it helps
          them understand that intelligence can be developed. It can also help
          them create better learning environments. The task at hand should have
          learning material that is targeted, significant to the objective,
          relevant and ideally individualized. The material should be repeated
          in different ways to strengthen the brain's connections and memory.
          The material should be engaging, which is important for
          neuroplasticity. Improving material to help learn may look like
          creating multisensory tasks, learning through play, and storytelling
          to help deepen the students' connection to the material.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will focus on one learning objective at a time and reduce other
          distractions whilst learning a new skill. I will also try to come back
          to old learning material and practice it regularly.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          The following activities should be done regularly to increase your
          brain's neuroplasticity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn new skills</li>
          <li>Exercise/ do physical activity</li>
          <li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet</li>
          <li>Get good rest and sleep</li>
          <li>Manage your stress levels and decrease cortisol</li>
          <li>Engage in social activities</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Discuss what it is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is a theory coined by Carol Dwerk. Although recent peer
          review studies have not been able to back her original work, the
          concept does seem to have some truth to it, at least to me. The theory
          suggests that those with a growth mindset are more willing to push
          through challenges and are not afraid of failure, this in turn
          increases their ability to learn and master new skills. Dwerk believes
          that those who look at failures as stepping stones, who accept they
          are in the ‘not yet’ phase but believe if they keep trying, they will
          achieve their goal, are considered people with a growth mindset. In
          terms of learning how to code in different languages, I think being
          able to take it step by step and to not let the feeling of defeat take
          over you, when code doesn’t work, will give you a higher chance at
          success in the long run.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t feel like anything has changed for me after this exploration.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’m going to be honest, the recent studies on growth mindset are very
          conflicting ( Burnette et al. (2023) , Macnamara and Burgoyne (2023) )
          so I am taking the concept with a grain of salt and will not be
          focusing on it during my studies. Rather, I will focus on mindfulness
          and EQ/IQ. I did find an article (linked below) that merges growth
          mindset with mindfulness which I think will have more impact for me.
          Here is one exercise from the text as an example:
        </p>
        <p>
          “The only way forward is through the emotions or problems and by
          following these steps we can start to tame and harness these tricky
          emotions: Name the feeling. Acknowledge it – sit with it – notice it
          with compassion and curiosity. Put it in perspective. Make a plan that
          links with your values and combines the ingredients of both grit and
          grace. “
