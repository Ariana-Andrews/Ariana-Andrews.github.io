        <h3>
          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
          CSS.
        </h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is like an employee in an office. It runs around in the
          background, doing everything that the boss, HTML desires, completing
          projects, moving paper and storing or retrieving things from the
          filing cabinet. CSSâ€¦ well CSS is like the uniform for the office, the
          brand, the marketing. It looks pretty and attracts customers.

        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The best analogy I had for control flow and loops was to compare it to
          a river... Control flow is the order in which a computer executes
          code, it runs top to bottom, just like water in a river. However there
          are lots and lots of things in a river that can change the flow of the
          water like rocks, branches and river banks (loops, conditionals etc).
          Sometimes the water will get sucked behind a rock and form an eddie,
          whirling around and around until the water meets a certain condition
          that allows it to join the main flow of water and continue down
          stream.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Document Object Model is essentially a bridge between HTML and
          Javascript (or other languages). It has a specific system structure
          that maps out HTML files, often referred to as a tree. This system
          allows devs to access specific elements and other html objects through
          JS code, and manipulate those objects from a js document.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are accessed using bracket notation with the numerical index
          that represents the data. For example:
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/JSF-example-1.jpg" alt="Array code example" />
        <p>
          Objects are accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. For
          example:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../assets/JSF-example-2.jpg"
          alt="Object code example dot notation"
        />
        <img
          src="../assets/JSF-example-3.jpg"
          alt="Object code example square bracket notation"
        />

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpfu</h3>
        <p>
          Functions perform tasks and calculate values. They take an input and
          return an output when called. They are helpful because they can be
          used to create reusable sections of code.
